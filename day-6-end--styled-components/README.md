# This project we will talk about styled-components
## Styled Components is an example of a CSS-in-JS library, where JavaScript is used to style components.
## Similar to CSS Modules, Styled Components results in local rather than global styles, though the library does provide for global styles as well as theming.
### official document for styled-components: https://styled-components.com/docs
### A big benefit of using Styled Components is being able to pass in a prop to the styled component (it is a component after all) and change styles based on the value of that prop.

### A downside of using Styled Components is that you need to come up with even more names for components.
